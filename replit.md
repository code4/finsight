# FinSight - Financial Advisory Platform

## Overview

FinSight is a professional financial advisory platform designed to provide portfolio analytics, risk assessment, and performance insights for financial advisors. The application follows a search-first, non-chatbot approach that emphasizes data discovery and structured answers rather than conversational interfaces. Built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, it features a Bloomberg Terminal-inspired design with dark mode priority and institutional-grade credibility.

## Current Focus & Goals

### Current Development Sprint (Sep 2025)
**Primary Goal**: Transform search experience from disjointed header input + overlay into unified command palette experience

**Vision**: Create a seamless, Bloomberg Terminal-inspired search interface where:
- Header search input and overlay work as one cohesive experience
- Professional, compact design with clear visual hierarchy  
- Full keyboard navigation and accessibility support
- Unified search across questions, categories, and recent queries
- Command palette pattern familiar to professional users

**Progress Status**:
- ‚úÖ Successfully consolidated headers and optimized space utilization (reduced from 64-112px to ~52px)
- ‚úÖ Identified core UX issue: search input and overlay feel completely separate instead of unified
- ‚úÖ Implemented Command-based structure with proper ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Unified search experience - header input and overlay now work as one cohesive command palette
- ‚úÖ Added professional focus management and seamless state synchronization
- ‚úÖ Created mobile-optimized Dialog interface for touch devices
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Prominent search interface in empty state with rotating placeholder animations
- ‚úÖ Optimized overlay space utilization with compact layouts and better information density
- üöß **In Progress**: Adding rotating typewriter animation for search placeholders to inspire FA questions
- ‚è≥ **Next**: Add fuzzy search with highlighting and search transition animations

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- Adopted shadcn/ui Command component for unified search interface
- Moved from separate header input + overlay to integrated command palette
- Implementing professional, compact Bloomberg-style design patterns
- Focus on accessibility with full keyboard navigation and ARIA support
